# Business Insights and Conclusions

**Insights**
* Using Recall as our main performance measure, the final model had a recall score of 85%.
* 15% of the time, the model will not detect a failure and will lead to a needed replacement, the highest cost for Renewind.
* The three most important features for identification are: V36, V16, V18
* The precision score is 68%, indicating that the model will falsely predict a failure in a healthy generator 32% of the time.


**Conclusions**

* The model is efficient with recall and could prove effective in saving money but the costs associate with repairs, replacement, and inspection require analysis.
* A calculator is provided above based on the chosen model. If replacement costs 1000, repair costs 500, and inspection costs 150, the company will save 91,350 dollars.
* The company needs to define a threshold for savings in order to determine if this model is suitable for production
